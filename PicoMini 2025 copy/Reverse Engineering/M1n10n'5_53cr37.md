### Tools Used
- `apktool` - For disassembling the APK
- `base64`/`base32` - For decoding the flag
- `grep` - For searching through files

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **APK Disassembly**

```bash
apktool d "minions (1).apk" -o disassembled_apk
```


2. **Package Discovery**

- Found main application package: `com.example.picoctfimage`

3. **Resource Analysis**

- Examined `res/values/strings.xml`
- Found suspicious string named "Banana":

```

<string name="Banana">OBUWG32DKRDHWMLUL53TI43OG5PWQNDSMRPXK3TSGR3DG3BRNY4V65DIGNPW2MDCGFWDGX3DGBSDG7I=</string>

```

4. **UI Hint Discovery**

- Found hint in `res/layout/activity_main.xml`:

```xml
<TextView android:text="Look into me my Banana Value is interesting" />
```

5. **Decoding Process**

- Initially tried Base64 decoding (failed - binary output)
- Tried Base32 decoding (success!):

```python
import base64

encoded = 'OBUWG32DKRDHWMLUL53TI43OG5PWQNDSMRPXK3TSGR3DG3BRNY4V65DIGNPW2MDCGFWDGX3DGBSDG7I='

decoded = base64.b32decode(encoded)

print(decoded.decode())
```

## Flag

```
picoCTF{1t_w4sn7_h4rd_unr4v3l1n9_th3_m0b1l3_c0d3}
```
